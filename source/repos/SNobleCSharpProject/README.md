Code Louisville C# Project, Shane Noble.

List of Products at a brewery.  Add a product or remove a product.

Focused on getting 'Add/Remove' to function and little else due to time consumed by all I broke and fixed in the process.

What I hope to fix:
- Organize menu and options.  I was getting lost, so I stopped trying to catch invalid user input 
  (i.e., on the 'Remove' choice, user can go OutofRange).
  - Know when to use Switch case and if else.
- Maybe some menu options should be made into their own method/function so it is cleaner/clearer.
- Add/Remove messes with the List array (in an unintended way).  prodCategory[x] changed to a wrong/different Part.
- Get to showing sales of the different products, added up from the data.
